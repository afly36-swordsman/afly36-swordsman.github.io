I created a blog in 2023 for two main reasons.
</p>

<p>
<div style="color:#4B0082">
Firstly, I've tried numerous note-taking software, including cloud-based options, but none of them quite fit the bill.
</div>

<div style="color:#000000">
Some don't offer real-time access, requiring exports and downloads, while others suffer from unstable servers prone to crashing, leaving me unable to access my notes when I need them most.
</div>
</p>

<div style="color:#191970">
Secondly, relying on GitHub to write my own blog allows me to access my recorded content anytime and anywhere with an internet connection.
</div>

<div style="color:#000000">
It's convenient, efficient, and I don't have to worry much about server crashes.
</div>
</p>

<p style="color:#CC0099">
Moreover, it's just plain cool! In a way, it provides a certain level of fulfillment for me mentally.
</p>

<p>
<div style="color:#008080">
The content of my blog mainly revolves around what I've learned, thought about, and experienced in my life, studies, research, and work.
</div>

<div style="color:#2F4F4F">
This includes some common sense that I found surprisingly unclear, enlightening research papers, and notes I've taken while learning various subjects, among other things.
