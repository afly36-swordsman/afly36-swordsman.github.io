I created a blog in 2023 for two main reasons.

Firstly, I've tried numerous note-taking software, including cloud-based options, but none of them quite fit the bill.
Some don't offer real-time access, requiring exports and downloads, while others suffer from unstable servers prone to crashing, leaving me unable to access my notes when I need them most.

Secondly, relying on GitHub to write my own blog allows me to access my recorded content anytime and anywhere with an internet connection.
It's convenient, efficient, and I don't have to worry much about server crashes.

Plus, it's just plain cool! In a way, it provides a certain level of fulfillment for me mentally.

The content of my blog mainly revolves around what I've learned, thought about, and experienced in my life, studies, research, and work.
This includes some common sense that I found surprisingly unclear, enlightening research papers, and notes I've taken while learning various subjects, among other things.
